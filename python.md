# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

1: Signature. Functions in Python are always starting with a "def", which means define.

3: This function receives one variable, the parameter variable.
4: Function's body
5: Local variable

The name of the constructor is: __init__(). The constructor can accept arguments.
Python uses it when initializing any instance variables that the object will need when it starts.
